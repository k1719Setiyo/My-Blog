This note begins and ends with the grid but there is much that is happening in between. 

**[Texas passes a law ](https://36889091.streak-link.com/Ce_Nw--T0zlt64G7mg01PEan/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.utilitydive.com%2Fnews%2Ftexas-law-gives-grid-operator-power-to-disconnect-data-centers-during-crisi%2F751587%2F)allowing the grid operator to forcibly disconnect data centers during power emergencies**. Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 6, giving ERCOT authority to mandate power disconnections from data centers and other large electricity consumers during grid emergencies. The law creates both mandatory curtailment during crisis events and a voluntary demand response program for facilities using 75+ MW, with 24-hour advance notice required. This comes as ERCOT forecasts large loads will surge from 87 GW today to 138 GW by 2030.

The Texas law comes amid broader grid reliability concerns that have already materialized across the United States. FERC had warned in May 2025 that this summer would be challenging for the US grid, with regions facing higher risks of power shortfalls under extreme weather conditions. These predictions proved accurate when the Department of Energy declared a power emergency in the Southeast in late June, while NYISO warned it may initiate emergency actions and PJM issued multiple alerts to avoid blackouts. During these stress events, electricity prices spiked dramatically—reaching nearly $2,400/MWh in New York City and topping $7,000/MWh on Long Island.

**[Prime Intellect does it again!](https://36889091.streak-link.com/Ce_Nw--FRey_04U-nQOks770/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.primeintellect.ai%2Fblog%2Fsynthetic-2)** It's no secret I'm a huge fan of open-source AI, and especially truly decentralized AI models taking their place alongside the closed, frontier systems. Prime Intellect launched and completed SYNTHETIC-2 in a staggering three days at the end of last week.

SYNTHETIC-2 is all about high-quality data for training AI models, and it generated 4 million verified reasoning samples. (fun fact: contributors were truly global, with GPUs from North America, Europe, and even Asia!). This isn't just fast; it's a monumental demonstration of what a decentralized community can achieve at scale.

Over 1,250 GPUs, from consumer cards like the 4090s to powerful enterprise H200s, joined their distributed network to churn out 4 million verified reasoning samples for complex reinforcement learning tasks (fun fact: contributors were truly global, with GPUs from North America, Europe, and even Asia!). A full open-source release and technical report are set to be released by them this week.

**[Researchers Develop AI That Forecasts](https://36889091.streak-link.com/Ce_Nw--7-zdMcvEsHwSqTi2Z/https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F2505.24511) stock prices to hospital vitals while explaining its predictions like a human expert.** Researchers from the University of Science and Technology of China have developed TimeReasoner, a groundbreaking approach to time series forecasting that uses large language models to predict future values through step-by-step reasoning rather than traditional pattern recognition. Unlike conventional AI forecasting systems that work like black boxes, TimeReasoner can explain its predictions in plain language while working across diverse applications—from electricity demand and stock prices to healthcare vital signs—without requiring specialized training for each domain.

The system consistently outperformed existing methods in testing across energy, finance, healthcare, environmental monitoring, and foreign exchange markets, but perhaps more importantly, it addresses two critical limitations of current AI forecast models: the inability to explain predictions and the need for extensive domain-specific training data. This research points toward a future where AI forecasting tools will be more like intelligent consultants that can both predict outcomes and explain their reasoning, making sophisticated forecasting accessible to organizations that lack the resources for custom AI development. While challenges remain around computational costs and ensuring prediction accuracy, this work represents a significant step toward more interpretable and democratized forecasting capabilities.

**[Electricity demand forecasts have become dangerously unreliable.](https://36889091.streak-link.com/Ce_Nw_DQ0EcvbxntXQuago0E/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iea-4e.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F05%2FData-Centre-Energy-Use-Critical-Review-of-Models-and-Results.pdf)****[ A recent independent study ](https://36889091.streak-link.com/Ce_Nw_DoqCQNMidH0A30icc1/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iea-4e.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F05%2FData-Centre-Energy-Use-Critical-Review-of-Models-and-Results.pdf)**analyzing over 100 forecasts revealed that baseline estimates for current data center power consumption vary by 6x between the lowest and highest estimates. When extrapolated forward, this uncertainty explodes into forecast ranges that differ by up to 40x. The stakes couldn't be higher (as evidenced by Senate Bill 6 in Texas). Without establishing agreed-upon baseline numbers, we're flying blind on one of the most critical infrastructure planning challenges of our time.
