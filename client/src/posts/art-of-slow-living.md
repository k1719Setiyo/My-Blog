I set out to test a growing narrative in the headlines that AI’s explosive growth is driving U.S. power prices up. The data tells a different story, and that’s where the real power paradox begins.

As a former energy trader during the shale boom, I’ve seen what happens when a supply or demand story takes hold. You can be right about the trend and still watch tens, if not hundreds, of billions of dollars get misallocated along the way.

That’s exactly what the data shows is happening with AI today. I remain bullish on its long-term power demand, but the way U.S. utilities and markets are pricing it feels dangerously familiar. Reliability is slipping, infrastructure costs are soaring, and distorted market signals are creating systemic risk.

The issue isn’t runaway AI-driven demand; it’s a grid under structural strain and markets rewarding the wrong behaviors. Texas, for example, is being celebrated for cheap power through new data center deals and surging utility stock prices, even as it edges toward a California-style reliability crisis.

To make the data easier to explore, I built a dashboard showing rising costs, falling reliability, and the reshaping of America’s power map in [The Power Paradox: Rising Costs, Falling Reliability, and the Data Center Boom](https://dashboard-kgnh8h.manus.space/).  Each tab in the dashboard analyzes the data around that particular theme.

The story isn’t just about AI’s hunger for power. It’s about how we’re choosing to feed it.

**What I Learned From the Data**

1. **The Grid Itself Is the Real Cost Bomb.** Infrastructure component costs have surged 43.2 percent since 2020, nearly twice the increase for renewable energy. We’re not just paying for new power sources but rebuilding a decaying system at enormous expense. Even today’s price hikes don’t cover what it will take to protect existing infrastructure, let alone build the new capacity AI will require. The grid has become the most expensive bottleneck in the energy transition.
2. **The Price Shock Is Shifting to Industrial Users.** Households once carried most of the grid’s cost burden, with residential prices up 126 percent since 2001 versus 83 percent for industrial users. That gap is closing fast. Since 2020, industrial power prices have jumped 39 percent, slightly ahead of residential at 37 percent. The era of cheap industrial power is ending, and AI’s true energy cost is starting to hit corporate balance sheets.
3. **Existing Data Centers Concentrate Risk, Not Prices.** Data centers aren’t driving national price hikes, but they are clustering in the weakest grids — Virginia, California, and Texas — linking critical digital infrastructure to systems increasingly prone to failure. The real danger isn’t price inflation but the fragility of the backbone supporting the digital economy.
4. **Data Centers Now Chase Cheap Power, Not Fiber.** Yesterday’s data centers followed fiber; today’s follow cheap power and light regulation. Meta’s new campuses — Prometheus in Ohio ($79.04/MWh) and Hyperion in Louisiana ($60.47/MWh) — are in low-cost states, as is Microsoft’s new Wisconsin project. With California power at $190.69/MWh, even small differences in cost translate into billions in savings for AI operations.
5. **Markets May Be Rewarding Phantom Demand.** Regional grid operators are forecasting nearly double the data center demand projected by independent analysts. That gap is being priced into markets as if it were real, risking billions in stranded assets if the growth fails to materialize. Consumers could ultimately pay for the overbuild.
6. **Financial Markets Are Betting on Unreliability.** The market continues to reward risk. Vistra, operating in the nation’s least reliable grid, has delivered over 900 percent returns on its stock price since October, 2020 while utilities in more stable regions lag. With data centers flocking to Texas for cheap power and minimal oversight, investors may be overlooking the next reliability crisis forming on the ERCOT grid. Grid costs are also rising faster than revenues; utility margins remain healthy for now, but the math won’t hold as capital spending surges and rates lag behind the true cost of reliability.
