In a world that prizes speed, choosing to go slow is a radical act. We are constantly bombarded with notifications, deadlines, and the pressure to "hustle." But what if the secret to a fulfilling life isn't doing more, but doing less?

## The Cost of Speed

When we rush, we miss the details. We drink our coffee without tasting it. We walk to work without seeing the trees. We talk to our friends without really listening.

> "Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished." — Lao Tzu

### Benefits of Slowing Down

| **Connection** | Being present deepens relationships. | Medium |

## How to Start

You don't need to move to a cabin in the woods to practice slow living. It starts with small, intentional choices:

1.  **Single-tasking:** Do one thing at a time. When you eat, just eat.
2.  **Digital Detox:** Turn off notifications for at least one hour a day.
3.  **Morning Ritual:** Start your day with 10 minutes of silence instead of scrolling.

The goal isn't to be lazy. It's to be *deliberate*. By slowing down, we regain control over our time and our attention.
