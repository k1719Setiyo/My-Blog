A cluttered desk is a cluttered mind. Over the years, I have refined my workspace to include only the essentials. Here is a breakdown of what I use and why.

## The Essentials

### 1. The Desk
A solid oak table. No drawers. Drawers are just places to hide junk. If it doesn't fit on the surface, I probably don't need it right now.

### 2. The Chair
Ergonomics are non-negotiable. I use a simple mesh chair that supports my back without looking like a spaceship.

### 3. The Analog Tools
*   **Notebook:** A Leuchtturm1917 for daily planning.
*   **Pen:** A Lamy Safari fountain pen. The friction of the nib on paper helps me think.

## Digital Minimalism

My computer desktop is empty. My dock is hidden. I use an app called "Hidden Bar" to tuck away menu bar icons.

By removing visual noise, I create a vacuum that my brain wants to fill with ideas. It's not about being an ascetic; it's about removing friction between thought and action.
