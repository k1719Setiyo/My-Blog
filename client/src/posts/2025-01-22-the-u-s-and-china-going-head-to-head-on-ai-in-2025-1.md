**Preface**

Most players in AI would have confidently told you back in the summer of 2024 that the Chinese frontier model companies were 2-3 years behind the U.S. The leaderboards and performance of models I was following said differently (although much of the world wasn’t paying attention). 

To form a clearer view on the AI race and energy conundrum, I looked at the dynamics through the lens of both AI and energy, both industries I know firsthand. Full paper attached. The nub:  

* China will lead in AI soon, *perhaps this year*, as measured by practicality, affordability, distribution, and reach into global markets. Why? China-- constrained by hardware--emphasized open-source (due to policy priorities set in its 2021 five-year plan), pre-training data quality, algorithmic efficiency, and architectural innovations. Building was done quietly with very few announcements in between.   
* The U.S. aimed for big and bold – more, more, more (data, parameters, hardware, compute). AGI and ASI have been the stated everything; efficiency, not so much. That could prove to be a strategic mistake if U.S. based frontier model companies don’t take the approach of “more with less”.  
* China’s position is enviable: the rare earth minerals market, cheaper models, no energy infrastructure constraints, and a welcome mat made of open-source code. China will do fine on chips before long. In other areas of technical innovation, it has a very strong track record of starting from behind to take a commanding lead.   
* The U.S. has anchors around its feet: a high dependence on importing rare earth minerals; permit acquisition snags; an over-taxed grid; supply chain nightmares; competing constituencies; and a much higher cost basis. All things that don’t get solved in a short time frame, regardless of how much capital is committed and why it is critical that infrastructure investments be combined with a serious focus on “more with less” by companies. 

The bottom line: DeepSeek is just the start. Of course, the global South will roll with Chinese models; they’re 30x cheaper and more flexible. If you’re in South Asia, Africa, or South America (or Europe for that matter) you’d be crazy to do anything else.   

This could be good news for investors. Disruption = investment opportunity (across the AI and energy stack, across stage, ranging from venture capital to public markets). But policymakers will need to wake up and rethink the landscape. U.S. frontier model companies need to crack the code on cost and efficiency.  

Google, Meta, X, and others are global today because they’re available to the masses, not just deep-pocket visionary customers. The ROI in the trillions of dollars that will be spent in the name of AI will come from inference, not training. And inference comes in the form of applications, practicality, and reach.
