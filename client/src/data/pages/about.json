  "body": "Welcome to **The Minimalist Reader**. This blog is a reflection of my journey towards simplicity, clarity, and focus in a noisy world.\n\nI believe that good design is invisible. It should get out of the way and let the content speak for itself. That's why I built this site with a focus on typography, whitespace, and readability.\n\n### What I Write About\n\n*   **Minimalism:** Finding joy in less.\n*   **Productivity:** Doing work that matters.\n*   **Design:** Creating calm in digital spaces.\n\n> \"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.\" — Leonardo da Vinci\n\nThank you for reading. I hope you find something here that resonates with you."
