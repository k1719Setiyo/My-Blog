  **Design Movement**: Swiss Style (International Typographic Style)
  **Core Principles**: Objectivity, readability, asymmetry, mathematical grids.
  **Color Philosophy**: Stark white background, black text, and a single bold primary color (e.g., Electric Blue #0055FF) for interactions to denote function without emotion.
  **Layout Paradigm**: Asymmetrical layouts with strong vertical axes. Content is aligned to a strict grid but often leaves columns empty for breathing room.
  **Signature Elements**: Large, flush-left typography; thick horizontal rules to separate sections; absence of decorative icons.
  **Interaction Philosophy**: Instant, sharp transitions. Hover states are binary (on/off) with no fade-in, emphasizing precision.
  **Animation**: None, or extremely fast (0.1s) linear translations.
  **Typography System**: *Helvetica Now* (or *Inter*) for everything. Huge, bold headings (80px+) contrasted with small, dense body copy (14px) with tight tracking.

  **Design Movement**: Wabi-Sabi / Organic Minimalism
  **Core Principles**: Imperfection, transience, nature, simplicity.
  **Color Philosophy**: "Paper" tones—warm off-whites (#FDFBF7), soft charcoal (#333333) for text, and muted earth tones (Sage, Clay) for accents.
  **Layout Paradigm**: Single-column, centered "reader" view. Margins feel hand-measured rather than calculated.
  **Signature Elements**: Subtle paper texture on background; soft, rounded edges on images; serif typography that feels like a book.
  **Interaction Philosophy**: Slow, gentle fades. Links underline slowly like ink drying on paper.
  **Animation**: Slow ease-in-out fades for page loads. Images might have a subtle parallax or "breathing" effect.
  **Typography System**: *Merriweather* (Serif) for body text to mimic a novel; *Lato* (Sans) for metadata (dates, tags) to keep it organized but unobtrusive.

  **Design Movement**: Brutalist Web Design
  **Core Principles**: Rawness, reaction against polish, default styles, high contrast.
  **Color Philosophy**: Monochromatic (Black/White) or jarring neon clashes (e.g., Neon Green background with Black text). Let's stick to B/W for readability but with raw borders.
  **Layout Paradigm**: Broken grids, overlapping elements, visible borders around every container.
  **Signature Elements**: System fonts (Courier, Times New Roman); visible scrollbars; raw HTML inputs for search; marquee text.
  **Interaction Philosophy**: Brutal and direct. Buttons depress visually (2px border becomes 1px).
  **Animation**: Glitch effects or raw CSS steps.
  **Typography System**: *Courier Prime* (Monospace) for body; *Times New Roman* (Serif) for headers. A mix of "default" looking fonts.
